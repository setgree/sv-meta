child sexual abuse prevention curriculum differs in
format depending upon the specific grade level of the
students being taught. At the fourth and fifth grade
level, the GT/BT curriculum requires two 45 minute
sessions. In session one, the presenter discusses a
number of concepts with the students and engages the
students in structured activities, including active
participation and rehearsal. Session two begins with a
review of the material taught in session one and is followed by a 15 minute film entitled ""No More Secrets"".
The film was chosen by the authors of the GT/BT program
for inclusion because it is age appropriate and it
presents in an acceptable way several of the concepts
taught in the program. Following the film, the remainder
of the 45 minute session is devoted to a postfilm
discussion period, and finally, a brief review of all
of the concepts taught in the program.","2,4",1,0,NA,3,"2,3,7",293,1,NA,"2,3,7"

Francisco, CA. According to this model, which is based on the empowerment ideas of
Sherover-Marcuse (1986), every workshop, regardless o f length, should contain the
following basic components: needs assessment, climate setting, experiential component,
didactic component, action component, closure component, and evaluation.
Needs assessment took place informally prior to the workshop by establishing the
desire of the UMC Residential Life department to offer a sexual harassment workshop,
and by review of research which indicates that sexual harassment is a pervasive problem
on campuses throughout the country. Climate setting activities, which are designed to put
the audience at ease, included establishment of facilitator credibility by informative
introductions; a playful warm-up activity designed to build trust and a risk-taking
atmosphere; and explanation of workshop schedule, guidelines, and working
assumptions. Participants are encouraged to speak out. Two experiential activities were
included. The first exercise, designed to recover and process memories of resistance and
oppression, combined the use of guided visualization, dyad sharing, and small group
sharing. The second activity was designed to empower participants to resist sexual
harassment by brainstorming situations and ways to solve them. The didactic component
of the workshop, postponed to after the experiential component because of the participants are thereby encouraged to do something concrete after the workshop. For
this activity, participants worked in dyads to generate ideas for do-able next steps, choose
an idea to implement, discuss obstacles and ways to overcome them, and write a
committment which both partners sign. The closure component, designed to be short and
up-beat, was planned to be a brief role play demonstrating effective intervention in sexual
harassment. Finally, the evaluation component was implemented by means of the
evaluation and research instruments given to the participants.
assumption in this framework that people will be more receptive to learning information
after an emotional connection has been established, was quite brief because of time
constraints. It consisted simply of going over the contents of the handout packet (see
Appendices K and L), as well as informing participants o f the procedure for victims of
sexual harassment on this campus. An action component is desirable, because

Workshop B (see Appendix J) was designed in consultation with Wayne Anderson, based
on the underlying assumptions that persuading people to change their attitudes about
sexual harassment will lead them to change their behaviors, people desire to hold
""correct"" attitudes (i.e. ones they believe are accurate for them), and that use of
experiential, interactive techniques will help group members feel more personally
involved with the topic material, thereby leading to central route attitude change. This
workshop was designed keeping in mind general considerations suggested by Anderson
(1981) and Pfeiffer and Jones (1973), such as the following. One of the most important
guiding considerations, investment and involvement, was operationalized by keeping
participants busy and engaged throughout the session. Sequencing was structured so that
each activity built upon the previous one. Adequate processing time was included in each
design component, assuring that pacing would be steady but challenging. Individual
participation in particular activites was made voluntary. Norms of openness,
experimentation, and sensitivity were established with guidelines early in the workshop.
Flexibility was assured by the employment of trainers experienced in the topic and
structured group techniques.
Workshop B began with brief introductory comments, a warm-up activity, and
discussion o f the schedule and guidelines. Guidelines were less extensive than those of
Workshop A, and unlike Workshop A, no working assumptions were presented in
Workshop B. Following the guidelines, there was a brief, impactful exercise to
demonstrate the scope of the problem of sexual harassment. Next, participants worked in
small, single-sex groups to define sexual harassment, after which they reported their
results to the large group for discussion. The concept that sexual harassment lies on a
continuum o f abuse was conveyed in a way that was designed to be persuasive by the
dramatic reading of a personal story, followed by small group discussions of reactions
and a lecturette. Next followed an exercise designed to forcefully convey sex differences
in precautions taken to try to ward off unwanted sexual attention, harassment, and assault;
o f course processing time in small groups was provided. Finally, small groups were
assigned the task of planning ways to handle being subjected to sexual harassment and
ways to respond when they see sexual harassment occuring.

Later, men are taught how to support a rape survivor. Men then learn the
basics of defining sexual consent and hear strategies for confronting peers as bystanders when they overhear others tell jokes about rape, act in ways that demean women, or brag about abusing women. Following that, men are taken through a guided imagery of a woman close to them who experiences rape under the influence of alcohol while a bystander watches and does nothing.

Three strategies were used to promote change in men’s understanding of masculinity, consent in dating relationships, and awareness of the norms and misperceptions that foster a rape-supportive culture. The 1st strategy fosters empathy regarding sexual assault and rape by providing men with the opportunity to describe the impact of sexual assault on women in their lives and discuss alternative explanations for men’s perceptions of false accusations of assault. The discussions where also are designed to facilitate empathy by focusing on the debunking of rape myths. The second change strategy increased awareness about conditions of consent. The participants diiscussed definitions and operationalizations of consent in specific scenarios. The third strategy aimed to foster bystander intervention and resocialization. Campus-wide and participant data were presented on men’s discomfort with the inappropriate behavior and language of other men. Data on true norms among men and the sharing of personal experiences by participants served to undermine traditional conceptions of masculinity that are associated with rape proclivity (i.e., risk factors). The bystander behavior module, which includes an interactive exercise, encourages the majority of nonassaultive men to intervene in the behavior of the minority to change the campus context from one that supports coercive behavior to one that inhibits it.
Men participated in a booster session review of program material approximately 4 months following initial program participation where conditions for consent were reviewed, normative data was provided, and bystander intervention strategies were discussed.

participants watched one of two sexual harassment training videos. Half of the participants
were randomly assigned to view the sexual harassment training video that was focused on
moral ideals and half of the participants were randomly assigned to view the sexual
harassment training video that was focused on moral obligation.
Although information in both conditions were equivalent in length, statements were
altered on the slides that induced either a moral ideals perspective that focused on positive
outcomes or a moral obligation perspective that focused on negative outcomes. For example,
both conditions discussed the outcomes of sexual harassment. In the moral ideals condition,
the slide stated, “If sexual harassment can be avoided, the consequences are positive physical
and emotional health, high work performance, and a respected reputation.” On the other
hand, in the moral obligation condition, the slide stated, “If sexual harassment does occur, the
consequences are negative physical and emotional health, low work performance, and a
disrespected reputation.” Therefore the messages in both conditions were the same, but the
way in which the message is framed differed across conditions.
Both videos were about 30 minutes in length and developed using the software
PowerPoint. Narrating audio for the videos utilized both male and female voices equally to
decrease the chances of trainer gender effects from occurring. Each participant was assigned

headphones. Once the video was finished, all participants were instructed to complete a

It also includes discussions of how community members can play important prevention roles as bystanders observing risky situations before and during acts of sexual violence (e.g., observing a very intoxicated person being lead into a bedroom at a party by a group of people) and afterward if approached by a friend who discloses that they have been a victim. Active learning exercises, such as role playing, are used to help participants think about how they might intervene safely and be a supportive ally to survivors. Particular emphasis is placed on participants’ own safety and on using resources such as campus police and rape crisis center resources.
Participants are also asked to generate a “bystander plan” and to sign a pledge (both of which they are asked to keep) that they would be active, prosocial bystanders in the community. During the program, participants are introduced to the notion of bystander responsibility, examine issues relating to sense of community membership, and are asked to draw upon their own experiences. Students also increase their awareness of sexual violence and are given an opportunity to apply bystander responsibility to sexual violence. Finally, the program is designed to increase awareness among participants about the importance of personal safety, resources available to aid them during intervention, and understanding the decision-making process behind successful bystander intervention. Students are also given information about campus resources, and facilitators serve as role models for expected behaviors

Stepping Up is based on Making Waves/Vague par vague. The Stepping Up project addressed the four components of the ecological model: individual, relationship, community, and society. Examples of these components as applied to a dating violence prevention curriculum include the following:
1. Individual – vulnerability (e.g., self-esteem, gender, incapacitation with drugs/alcohol), self-protective behaviours, risks;
2. Relationships – healthy relationships, power and control, conflict resolution;
3. Community – sources for seeking help, role of bystander or peers (i.e., social responsibility); and
4. Society – the role of myths (e.g., relationships or sexual assaults) and gender stereotypes (e.g., masculinity).
These components were also incorporated at a program delivery level. The program was aimed at facilitating changes in individuals and their relationships. The community was actively involved, with a number of advisory members and project partners. Their involvement demonstrated the commitment of the university and the external community to the prevention of dating violence and the willingness to seek social change. Development of a critical mass of people with awareness and capacity related to dating violence prevention, coupled with the use of peer group facilitators, has the potential to effect wider social change.",2,4,0,NA,3,"1,2,4,9",30,0.5,NA,"1,2,4,9"

The first phase of the this project focused on sexual assault prevention/consent negotiation, specifically on deconstructing the sociocultural factors that contribute to sexual assault and rape culture on college campuses. In what follows, we first provide an overview of the approach and a brief description of the game prototype. Then, on the basis of preliminary data from an extensive evaluation of the effec- tiveness, feasibility, and likeability of the game, we will explain how the game, paired with other evidenced-based intervention models such as the bystander intervention, ex- emplifies a promising approach to SAPE.",7,11,1,"1,2,3,4,6,8,9",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1,2,3,4,6,8,9"

This campaign consisted of images portraying “typical” college scenes explicitly modeling prosocial bystander behavior in the prevention of sexual and relationship violence. A series of posters was hung throughout each campus (e.g., residence halls, student cen- ters, athletic venues, dining areas, academic buildings). In addition, images appeared on table tents in the dining halls, bookmarks distributed in libraries and bookstores, the sides of buses (Campus 1 only), and splash pages on campus computer clusters (Campus 1 only). And at the start of each cam- paign, 1st-year students on both campuses received promotional products such as water bottles, key chains, pins, backsacks, and flash drives featuring the campaign slogan and website address (Potter, 2012). Images were tai- lored to each campus to reflect the racial and ethnic composition of students and social situations typical of the campus. Thus, by the 12-month follow-up, the program group had been exposed to both the in-person program and the social marketing campaign, whereas the control group had been exposed to the social marketing campaign only.

One of the programs is Not Anymore, an interactive online program designed to help students better understand consent, bystander intervention, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, and stalking. Other programs the university sponsored were Coaching Female Athletes: For Sports, For Life, based on the Coaching Boys into Men program, and a university-wide screening and discussion of “The Hunting Ground.” The university also took steps such as hiring a full-time Title IX coordinator, securing a contact to deliver sexual violence prevention training to all students, and creating a matrix of prevention, education, and training programs and courses throughout the university.

common characteristics associated with high-risk perpetrators, (b) raise women’s willingness
to intervene in potential sexual assault situations, and (c) provide women with information
to aid rape survivors. In addition, the program operates on the belief that leaching
and empowering women to be active bystanders not only increases the likelihood they
would intervene in a potential sexual assault situation but also leads women to recognize
threats to personal safety and engage in appropriate risk-reducing behavior. Facilitators of
the program are typically female undergraduate students or professional presenters.
The program is divided into five sections (Parts A-E). Material is presented verbally
along with a slide presentation and through an instructional DVD. Parts A (Establishing
Rapport and Definitions) and B (Recognizing Dangerous Men) of the program are
primarily psychoeducational. Participants are presented with (a) an overview of the
program, (b) definitions of terms used frequently throughout the presentation (i.e., rape,
mental capacity, physical helplessness), (c) statistics regarding the prevalence of sexual
assault, and (d) common characteristics of perpetrators. In Parts C (Helping a Friend)
and D (Becoming an Active Bystander), the use of the bystander intervention approach
to sexual assault prevention is evident. The main points addressed in these parts are the
appropriate manner to handle a sexual assault disclosure and safe ways to intervene during
a potential sexual assault situation. Finally, in Part E (Closing), participants are invited to
provide comments and ask questions regarding the information presented and arc asked to
commit to the actions they are willing to take to prevent a sexual assault.

The second module is comprised of a social norms activity and a discussion of common rape myths, including the topics of heteronormativity and gendered language within rape myths. The social norm (Brown & Messman-Moore, 2010) activity is used to challenge perceived peer norms towards sexual aggression.

Facilitators interview for this position, with selection based in part on relatability to the target groups (athletes and fraternity members; for example, facilitators often have prior experience on an athletic team or are themselves a fraternity member). 
At the start of Wingman 101, participants are introduced to bystander theory, and facilitators use each scenario to highlight the role of the community (in this case, the athletic team) in preventing sexual violence. Wingman 101 also draws on understandings of the importance of addressing social norms to create community social change. In Wingman 101, the scenarios are used to foster social norms-based discussion,
for example, by demonstrating that others on the team are also concerned with sexual violence and would support the efforts of a teammate to prevent this violence. Finally, as part of strengths-based practice, the focus of the program is not on individual behaviors associated with perpetration, but rather on emphasizing a community prevention approach that draws on the strengths (e.g., bonding) of these intact groups.

units designed for small groups (20 or fewer) of women led
by two well-trained female facilitators. Each unit employed
games, mini-lectures, facilitated discussions, small and large
group exercises, as well as application and practice using
written scenarios, audio and video clips, and role-play.
In Unit 1 (Assess), participants learned how to discern the
level of risk for sexual assault present in situations involving
male acquaintances and to develop problem-solving strategies
aimed at minimizing the advantages of potential perpetrators.
For example, the Assess unit identifies “presence of
alcohol” (no matter who is drinking it) as one of the key
situational cues that elevates risk of sexual assault. Activities
in both Assess and Acknowledge units provide women with practice at identifying and undermining perpetrator advantages
in situations that involve alcohol. This means that
approximately 90 min of the 12 hr of EAAA programming
includes discussion of the issue of alcohol-facilitated sexual
assault, alone or in combination with other risk factors, and
counteracts related myths. In Unit 2 (Acknowledge), the
women were taught to recognize quickly the dangers inherent
in situations that have turned coercive. They were provided
with activities to help them develop strategies to prioritize
their sexual rights and overcome the emotional barriers to
seeing the danger and to engaging in resistance against men
they know. In Unit 3 (Act), participants received instruction
and practice on a variety of effective verbal and physical
resistance strategies with a focus on common acquaintance
sexual assault scenarios. In Unit 4 (Relationships and Sexuality),
content from the previous three units was integrated
and applied to participants’ sexual lives by providing a context

The curriculum involved three main topic areas. The first focuses on the theme of gender, masculinity and power, allowing the young men to actively reflect on the messages and expectations that they have received from society about manhood and gender norms. The second topic focuses on the theme of violence. This includes several components: an exploration of the various forms of violence, its impact on communities, and the role that masculinity may contribute; identifying healthy versus unhealthy romantic relationships; sexual consent and decision making; and bystander interventions when witnessing abusive behavior. The final topic area focuses on sexual and reproductive health, which includes providing information about sexual health and contraception, condom and contraceptive de- monstrations, tying health behaviors and access to health facilities to conceptions of masculinity, and opportunities to ask medical professionals sexual health-related questions.","1,2",6,0,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,"1,3,4,9","1,3,4,9"

Each year two to three advertisements were developed. Posters, bus wraps, table tents, and billboards were placed around campus with a branded logo and catchy designs.

The bystander program focused on how all students are affected by violence and how all students can play a role in preventing it both at the individual and at the community level. The bystander education defined bystanders as individuals who may witness violence occurring or situations at high-risk for violence, and in their presence, they may have the opportunity to provide assistance, do nothing, or contribute to the negative behavior. The bystander education clearly outlined the elements of bystander decision mak- ing before, during, and after crisis situations. The “three D” approach was taught for responding as a bystander. These were direct, delegate, and distract responses. The students also spent time learning how to listen, believe, and be empowered to assist.

Specifically, it incorporated a peer model component, meaning that classmates themselves are tasked with leading some of the sessions; e) it combines classroom and web-based activities, the latter via the program’s online platform; f) it welcomes a final activity organized by the participating schools covering the main content and lessons learned following intervention; and g) it adopts a constructivist and experiential approach that encourages content learning through different teaching and learning experiences.

The strategy of the project first starts with the trainers who hold two-hour orientations which include a docudrama and discussion with all the girls at a school. Then four or five girls from each grade who show an interest in being student leaders are chosen to serve on the School Watch Group (SWG). These girls serve as an intermediary between their peers and the MEJNIN trainer. They not only serve as an advocate for their peers but also refer problems that arise to the MEJNIN trainer. The programme also coordinates a Community Watch Group (CWG) whose members organise informational meetings for parents, identify local hotspots of harassment in the community and keep in close contact with the local police. In addition, they help the SWG when problems arise including arbitrating sexual harassment incidents. If the seriousness of the harassments warrants it, the cases are passed on to the legal authorities. At the meso-level BRAC works with school administrators, local police, SMC members, and teachers. At the national and macro-level, the programme use media for publishing different messages related to sexual harassment and coordinate national conferences for students and other stakeholders including government officials and journalists. In the case of unresolved incidents, MEJNIN programme organises rallies and arranges processions in coordination with other NGOs. Through this project teacher at the intervention schools also receive psychosocial training and the Teacher Watch Groups are formed. In addition to these, alliances with like-minded NGO’s are formed to fight against sexual harassment.","2,4,6",NA,0,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,"9,5,1","9,5,1"

Facilitators described the overlap between SV and drinking, and presented methods for reducing personal and peer risk. Regarding SV, facilitators gave participants information on the definitions of sexual assault and consent, prevalence of SV on campus, challenges to common rape myths, and relevant campus/ local resources.

They placed special emphasis on SV incidents that involved substance-related incapacitation. The intervention also included interactive vignettebased exercises designed to highlight bystander intervention behaviors in potentially risky situations.
