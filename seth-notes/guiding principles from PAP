### Introductory remarks
* The quantitative review will aggregate individual data from all participants and, when necessary, will estimate intent-to-treat effects rather than treatment effects on the treated (in keeping with our emphasis on policy-relevant effects). 

* The planned analytic approach is random-effects meta-analysis; the treatments are heterogeneous, as are the populations. 

* Our intended statistical approach is frequentist. 

*The main outcomes of interest are which interventions, and in which populations, treatments have the strongest effects;

* we will also assess quality of evidence overall with respect to possibilities of publication bias, internal validity of studies, reliability and noisiness of dependent variables, and ultimately ease of high-fidelity implementation. We will attempt this quantitatively where possible and qualitatively where not.

* Tests for publication bias will follow those in â€˜The contact hypothesis re-evaluated', https://doi.org/10.1017/bpp.2018.25.
* Statistical analyses will be conducted in R, drawing from the CRAN view page on meta-analysis  (https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MetaAnalysis.html) or functions of our own creation when needed.
* Statistical heterogeneity is expected. Available covariates are likely to vary widely, so with the exceptions of population and setting of intervention, any moderator analysis is speculative.
