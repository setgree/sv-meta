Although we exclude papers focusing on especially at-risk populations, some papers described populations as being at-risk in ways we didn't agree with, e.g. sorority members. This variable flags those instances.",Number of conditions in the overall study,Number of control participants at pretest,Number of control participants at posttest,Number of treatment participants at pretest,Number of treatment participants at posttest,number of treatment clusters,number of control clusters," ""cluster randomized"" for randomly assigned at the level of a cluster; ""cluster_assigned"" is assigned at the level of a cluster but not randomly; ""n groups"" if treatment was assigned individually but administered in groups",effect size type. used for the Glas's Delta calculator,unstandardized effect size. used for glass's Delta calculator,1=improvement; -1=decrease; 0 = null; NA=insufficient information,standard deviation of the control group. Used for Glass's Delta calculator, Unique identifier for each paper ,unique identifer per study,a robustness check for studies that we classified as quasi-experimental because of too few clusters. We conduct this robustness check in the exploratory analyses script,"attitudes, perpetration, victimization, involvement, or bystander behaviors",decade in which the study was published, n_t_post + n_c_post; useful for conducting quantile analyses,divide the dataset into quantiles based on total sample size,lead author and year pasted together. used for a forest plot in our exploratory analyses,random assignment,a binary variable for whether there was a delay between treatment and measurement or not,binary variable for whether a study was published or not,"whether a study measures ideas, behaviors, or both. Useful for our correlation analyses ",0 =measures  ideas only; 1 = measures both; 2 = measures behavior only,standardized effect size (Delta),variance of Delta,standard erorr of Delta,
