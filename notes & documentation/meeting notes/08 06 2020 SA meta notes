We've coded almost all of the studies
20 more studies have been qualitatively coded but not quantitative
JH is going to code those studies

Joni is checking the coding of the RCTs, like how much time the intervention
took
victimization and perpetration measures

70/87 things done

3 arms to the paper

* Betsy and Ana write the paper

* Roni is highlighting themes

** Example trend: 80s study view all men as potential perpetrators, to viewing
men as potential allies, bystanders, etc.

A few things for Seth and some issues

* programs that have been rigorously evaluated
** go over these papers and check the codes, so they need to be right
 -- these high quality studies don't seem to be reducing victimization &
perpetration
** -- my take on on these studies

* More or less an analysis plan -- start downloading and cleaning the data
so we're further ahead

ISSUE: Which formula to use
pooled SD
SE to SD: double-check each of these studioes to see if htere is a easier way to
report the SD (perhaps it's in plain text), and, if not, do the T-test = Beta/SE

Programs were covered in multiple papers: Foschee in 1998, cluster by study even
though it's across many papers. Need some solution for clustering across papers.


Adapt our Prejudice code to blah blah blah



Suggestion for future research: ask likely perpetrator questions about perpetration, not victimization, because that will make effects more obvious rather than conditioning on the entire population when you think half the population is, statistically, very unlikely to perpetrate.


Time trends of men and women: started with just men ,then put everyone in, but there's something lost there because if men perpetrate, we should start from that reality.
