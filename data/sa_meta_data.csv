Subjects were guided by a narrator through some of the short- and long-term sequelae of sexual victimization. In addition, possible personal consequences of raping were discussed, including the low likelihood of personal and victim's enjoyment of the coerced sex, the likelihood of feeling ashamed, feeling guilty, harming one's reputation, arrest, conviction, imprisonment, worrying abut contracting a sexually transmitted disease, actually contracting a STD, and negative impact upon future career. Finally, a behavioral exercise was included to increase subjects' involvement in the program, to improve their processing of the information, and to serve as a manipulation check.

enable students to be aware of potentially abusive situations and to disclose
CSA and other abuses. Program objectives include increasing student identification
of safe and risky people and situations as well as who to disclose
to. The program developed from survivor experience with no theoretical
base. Program content includes a series of discussion topics, such as bullying,
physical and sexual assault/abuse, domestic violence, gender issues,
and power in society. The main activities are movement and debate to topics
presented as provocative statements; for example, “It is okay to hit a woman”
for the topic of domestic violence. Students move to either side of the class
(or the middle) to signify agreement, disagreement, or uncertainty. Students
give their reasons and the presenter summarizes. The fourth lesson uses
the board game Truth Dare Scare. Students roll a dice and answer personal
safety questions—either telling the truth, sharing what scares them, or taking
a dare (e.g., a silly dance). Lessons are 50 minutes long. Presenters receive a
1-hour training delivered by the program author. Training includes program
aims/objectives, content, delivery style, confidentiality limits, and response
to disclosure.","2,5",4,~200 minutes,0,"2,3,11",0.5,"2,3,11",both,24,NA,NA,quasi-experimental,TRUE,attitudes,-,2,175,175,205,205,10,9,cluster randomized,f.test,2.195,1,-,10,NA,,,,Roni,"I changed from RCT to quasi experimental because in one school 7 classes were randomized, where in the other two school randomization was done at the school level.

Finally, five case studies were discussed. The last exercise was carried out
with students working together in small groups. The results of each group’s
discussion were shared and presented in a general session, conducted by the

written scenarios, audio and video clips, and role-play.
In Unit 1 (Assess), participants learned how to discern the
level of risk for sexual assault present in situations involving
male acquaintances and to develop problem-solving strategies
aimed at minimizing the advantages of potential perpetrators.

alcohol” (no matter who is drinking it) as one of the key
situational cues that elevates risk of sexual assault. Activities
in both Assess and Acknowledge units provide women with practice at identifying and undermining perpetrator advantages
in situations that involve alcohol. This means that

includes discussion of the issue of alcohol-facilitated sexual
assault, alone or in combination with other risk factors, and

Workshop B (see Appendix J) was designed in consultation with Wayne Anderson, based
on the underlying assumptions that persuading people to change their attitudes about
sexual harassment will lead them to change their behaviors, people desire to hold
""correct"" attitudes (i.e. ones they believe are accurate for them), and that use of
experiential, interactive techniques will help group members feel more personally
involved with the topic material, thereby leading to central route attitude change. This
workshop was designed keeping in mind general considerations suggested by Anderson
(1981) and Pfeiffer and Jones (1973), such as the following. One of the most important
guiding considerations, investment and involvement, was operationalized by keeping
participants busy and engaged throughout the session. Sequencing was structured so that
each activity built upon the previous one. Adequate processing time was included in each
design component, assuring that pacing would be steady but challenging. Individual
participation in particular activites was made voluntary. Norms of openness,
experimentation, and sensitivity were established with guidelines early in the workshop.
Flexibility was assured by the employment of trainers experienced in the topic and
structured group techniques.
Workshop B began with brief introductory comments, a warm-up activity, and
discussion o f the schedule and guidelines. Guidelines were less extensive than those of
Workshop A, and unlike Workshop A, no working assumptions were presented in
Workshop B. Following the guidelines, there was a brief, impactful exercise to
demonstrate the scope of the problem of sexual harassment. Next, participants worked in
small, single-sex groups to define sexual harassment, after which they reported their
results to the large group for discussion. The concept that sexual harassment lies on a
continuum o f abuse was conveyed in a way that was designed to be persuasive by the
dramatic reading of a personal story, followed by small group discussions of reactions
and a lecturette. Next followed an exercise designed to forcefully convey sex differences
in precautions taken to try to ward off unwanted sexual attention, harassment, and assault;
o f course processing time in small groups was provided. Finally, small groups were
assigned the task of planning ways to handle being subjected to sexual harassment and
ways to respond when they see sexual harassment occuring.

Francisco, CA. According to this model, which is based on the empowerment ideas of
Sherover-Marcuse (1986), every workshop, regardless o f length, should contain the
following basic components: needs assessment, climate setting, experiential component,
didactic component, action component, closure component, and evaluation.
Needs assessment took place informally prior to the workshop by establishing the
desire of the UMC Residential Life department to offer a sexual harassment workshop,
and by review of research which indicates that sexual harassment is a pervasive problem
on campuses throughout the country. Climate setting activities, which are designed to put
the audience at ease, included establishment of facilitator credibility by informative
introductions; a playful warm-up activity designed to build trust and a risk-taking
atmosphere; and explanation of workshop schedule, guidelines, and working
assumptions. Participants are encouraged to speak out. Two experiential activities were
included. The first exercise, designed to recover and process memories of resistance and
oppression, combined the use of guided visualization, dyad sharing, and small group
sharing. The second activity was designed to empower participants to resist sexual
harassment by brainstorming situations and ways to solve them. The didactic component
of the workshop, postponed to after the experiential component because of the participants are thereby encouraged to do something concrete after the workshop. For
this activity, participants worked in dyads to generate ideas for do-able next steps, choose
an idea to implement, discuss obstacles and ways to overcome them, and write a
committment which both partners sign. The closure component, designed to be short and
up-beat, was planned to be a brief role play demonstrating effective intervention in sexual
harassment. Finally, the evaluation component was implemented by means of the
evaluation and research instruments given to the participants.
assumption in this framework that people will be more receptive to learning information
after an emotional connection has been established, was quite brief because of time
constraints. It consisted simply of going over the contents of the handout packet (see
Appendices K and L), as well as informing participants o f the procedure for victims of
sexual harassment on this campus. An action component is desirable, because

Active learning exercises, such as role playing, are used to help participants think about how they might intervene safely and be a supportive ally to survivors. Particular emphasis is placed on participants’ own safety and on using resources such as campus police and rape crisis center resources.
Participants are also asked to generate a “bystander plan” and to sign a pledge (both of which they are asked to keep) that they would be active, prosocial bystanders in the community. During the program, participants are introduced to the notion of bystander responsibility, examine issues relating to sense of community membership, and are asked to draw upon their own experiences. Students also increase their awareness of sexual violence and are given an opportunity to apply bystander responsibility to sexual violence. Finally, the program is designed to increase awareness among participants about the importance of personal safety, resources available to aid them during intervention, and understanding the decision-making process behind successful bystander intervention. Students are also given information about campus resources, and facilitators serve as role models for expected behaviors

This campaign consisted of images portraying “typical” college scenes explicitly modeling prosocial bystander behavior in the prevention of sexual and relationship violence. A series of posters was hung throughout each campus (e.g., residence halls, student cen- ters, athletic venues, dining areas, academic buildings). In addition, images appeared on table tents in the dining halls, bookmarks distributed in libraries and bookstores, the sides of buses (Campus 1 only), and splash pages on campus computer clusters (Campus 1 only). And at the start of each cam- paign, 1st-year students on both campuses received promotional products such as water bottles, key chains, pins, backsacks, and flash drives featuring the campaign slogan and website address (Potter, 2012). Images were tai- lored to each campus to reflect the racial and ethnic composition of students and social situations typical of the campus. Thus, by the 12-month follow-up, the program group had been exposed to both the in-person program and the social marketing campaign, whereas the control group had been exposed to the social marketing campaign only.

dating violence in at-risk college students. Mixed-gender groups of six

sessions (similar in structure to Schwartz et al., 2004). Each group had two facilitators;
the lead facilitator of each group had a master’s degree in clinical psychology.
Facilitators met weekly with the third author (DD), a licensed psychologist, for supervision
and to review group content (to ensure fidelity). Group sessions were didactic
and experiential in nature, and participants were assigned homework after each session
to assist with skills generalization. Each of the four sessions focused on addressing
specific risk factors of dating violence, drawing on theory and techniques from
empirically supported interventions, including aspects of mindfulness-based stress
