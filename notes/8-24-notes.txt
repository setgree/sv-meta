# put SETH in the checker and checked thing if I make anty changes
and, if anything *besides* u_s_d, eff_type, and ctrl_sd,
make a note in checker comments

# how do people typically do a correlation between atts and behavs
within a study? 
*Table where the eff_types are blank
 ** someone has to look at the blank eff_types :)
 #JH-coding.xlsls -- figure out why these are NA

 ** 37 DIMS or DIDs where the SD is blank, we need to fix those

 * Seth is on the betas
 * log odds will all be positive when Seth is through with them
  meaning that I will convert to DIP when possible and make positive
  and change directional note when not

 Roni will redo Foshee and then Seth will double-check
 * line 74 safe dates -- revisit this study (Seth) and find an SD

SETH: if then syntax for Cohen's D based on cluster information as
per my notes in the cohens D doc

attrition: two things that are of interest. First is, just what percent of
people in the studies remain in the studies? Just interesting and that's
e.g. mean(n_t_post) / mean(n_t_pre)
and the second is that differential attrition in the RCTs is a problem, we
think, and need to investigate

* Look at the outliers, and those where var_d = 0, and those where var_d or d
is NA

The cross-sectional studies are weird, and we are going to need a bit more
attention to classifying them


# SETH TODO: convert `delay` into days and make the NAs zero
