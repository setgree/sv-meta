November 2023 next steps

1. Roni: revise PRISMA diagram and upload to Overleaf (I sent a separate email)
2. JH/Roni: provide guidance on a few undocumented variables (I sent a separate email)
3. Anyone: read the paper and appendix one more time...? We could be past that but I wouldn't mind someone double-checking that I didn't put anything crazy in while updating the #s
4. Seth/Alex update codebook.csv based on coding instructions.docx and data_extraction_items.docx. (@Alex Sanchez is this something you can get started on? I'd like for us to have a CSV file that corresponds column-by-column to our final dataset, sv_meta_data.rds, where the first row is the name of the variable and the second row is an explanation of that variable.)
5. Seth: Once that's all done, tidy the accompanying materials up for online publication on Dataverse
6. someone: email the final draft, appendix, and bibliography of database to Becca and Nora ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ 


October 2023 todos

1. go through all the anticipated direction = 0 studies and make sure that we're not 
rounding down any real results to 0. There are some Ds calculated and we should be mindful of that DONE

2. Follow up with JH about the type_of_at_risk var DONE

once Alex's changes get implemented:  DONE
1) download everything
2) re-run script 1
3) turn it into docmumentation (e.g. make it a txt file)

Then,
1) implement all of Martin's changes DONE

Then DONE
1) rename everything so the scripts are in the right order
2) modiy the run.sh to reflect new shape
3) delete all extra datasets
4) amend the readme accordingly

Then, 
1) significantly amend the codebook (probably using Google Docs to do this) to line up the 
listed variables with those actually in the dataset

Then, final, comprehensive read-through
