got organized (put everything into asana)

* fixed errors in labels that stopped Cohen's D script from working
* started thinking about the problem of study needs to have one behavioural outcome and one attitudinal

* new idea for a graph: 
  * show how effect size changes as you move from everything, to just attitudes (goes up), to just behaviors(goes down) to just RCT attitudes (not sure) to RCT behaviors (lowest). How to portray this?
* solved a few technical things -- group_by and then variable contains ALL of values, and a unique_study_id
* have some preliminary results to dicsuss about the diminishing effects as you go up the scale in terms of study quality and behavirs
* but do attitudes predict behaviors? This one is actually a hard question. Talk to Don & Betsy about it?
